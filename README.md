Data visualization through the Graph data structure.

## python-modules
- [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
- [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

## how-it-works
The first line of the text file (must be in the "data" folder) must contain the type of graph  
  > :round_pushpin: **ND** -> undirected graph  
  > :round_pushpin: **D** -> directed graph
  
followed by _n_ lines of edges. For example:
```
ND
A,B
B,C
C,D
C,A
...
```

After configuring the text file, just run main.py and play with the results :smile:
